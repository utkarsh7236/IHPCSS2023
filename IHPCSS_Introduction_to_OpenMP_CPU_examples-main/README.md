# OpenMP for CPU - Examples

In this repository, you will find the examples to practice OpenMP for CPU parallel programming. These are meant to illustrate a specific technique covered in the lecture.

# Structure

There are two directories: C and F, representing the C and FORTRAN versions of the exercises. The exercises covered are identical, they are just provided in two different programming languages for convenience.

Each exercise contains:
- `src`: the folder in which you will find the source code.
- `bin`: the folder in which the executable will be produced.
- `makefile`: the makefile issuing the compilation command.
- `submission`: the submissio script, if you are to submit the execution of that executable to cirrus.
